"The Computing Science degree was not an educational path I originally looked for - it found me. 
After my first course in the Computing Science program, I never looked back.
There are a variety of things that made my time at TRU worthwhile and helped me achieve my goals. 
There is a wide range of courses that involve not only technical understanding of course material, 
but applied learning as well.
Getting your hands dirty" in the software, hardware, and languages being learned assisted me to gain a stronger understanding of important material."
