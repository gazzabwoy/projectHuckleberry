Curtis:

Back End Developer

I was always interested in computing in school so decided to go to University to further my knowledge. 
I didn’t have the best interpersonal skills and felt uncomfortable speaking in front of people. 
I really enjoy the challenge of developing complex code. 
Working as a back-end developer I don’t need to speak with clients as often.
